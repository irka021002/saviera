Pak Taswan explained.<br/><br/>Pak Taswan also stated that he imagined the person wearing this piece as <span class="font-bold">"A calm but also a bold person"</span> given the sheer fabric.

A simple yet adaptable color. <br/><br/>We found a beautiful deadstock fabric that is too shameful to waste. We acknowledge that it is hard to trace where or how the raw materials are produced. However, as one of our ways to exercise our sentiments (the People, Planet, and Fashion Industry), we are using deadstock fabric to reduce textile waste, which is one of the options for our eco-conscious effort.
